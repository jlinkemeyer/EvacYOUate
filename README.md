# EvacYOUate - Investigating trust towards post-earthquake evacuation robots with different voice properties
This repository contains the supplementary material for an experiment created as part of the course *Human-robot interaction* at Osnabr√ºck University.

The guiding question of our experiment is: *How is trust towards evacuation robots affected by verbal communication differences in gender and authority?*

## Directories
This repository contains three directories with the following contents:

### DataAnalysis
... contains the datasets (results from post-experiment questionnaire and compliance scores), the code to analyse said datasets and create the plots used in our paper, as well as those plots.

### NewAssets
... contains objects we created from scratch for our Unity scenery. Included are objects to simulate a post-earthquake situation (crashed shelfs, gravel, and unstable floor) and the evacuation robot we designed and implemented specifically for the post-earthquake situations in our experiment.

### UnityProject
... is the full Unity project we created for our experiment. Please note that the version that is published in this repository is not the version we used in our experiment for the following reason: In the original experiment we used an existing house model. Licensing restrictions do not allow us to make the original experiment public, which is why we created the version of our experiment that is available here. In this version, the house is exchanged with a very basic house model created from scratch.
